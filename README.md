# System Control and  Interface - Compliance Suite

## Introduction
**System Control and Management Interface** (SCMI)  is a set of Operating System-independent software interfaces that are used in system management.

For more information, download the [SCMI Platform Design Document](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0056/b/?lang=en).

## SCMI Compliance suite
SCMI compliance suite is a collection of self-checking, portable C tests. SCMI compliance suite enables adopters of SCMI Platform Design Document \(PDD\) to test their own implementations. It provides a predefined library of tests and a test framework to execute these tests. The test suite can be adapted to different platforms. It also enables the extension of the current test library to include platform-specific custom commands and custom protocols.

## Release details
 - Code quality: REL v2.0.
 - The tests are written for version 2.0 of the SCMI PDD.
 - The compliance suite maintains backward compatibility with version 1.0 of the SCMI PDD.
 - The compliance suite is not a substitute for design verification.
 - The compliance suite is verified against [SCP-firmware](https://github.com/ARM-software/SCP-firmware).
 - To know about the gaps in the test coverage, see the [Test checklist].

## GitHub branch

## Test scenarios

The mapping of the rules in the specification to the test cases and the steps followed in the tests are mentioned in the [Test checklist].

## Getting started
See the [User Guide] for instructions to adapt, build and run the test suite.
